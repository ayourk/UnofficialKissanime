            Kodi v17 updated to Python 2.7.10 from 2.7.5 in v16, which introduced this error when 
            trying to resolve the url:
            http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27835619/ssl-certificate-verify-failed-error

            In Kodi v16, python would not verify the SSL certs or at least ignore, but they changed
            with the upgrade to v17.  Sometimes the cert from the initial decrypted URL is invalid,
            so to avoid errors, we temporarily disable SSL to get the resolved URL.  Although this
            workaround isn't secure, I figure it's not any worse than before...
